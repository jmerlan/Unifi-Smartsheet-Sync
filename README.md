# Unifi-Smartsheet Sync

## Overview

This application synchronizes data between Revit families stored in Unifi and data stored on Smartsheet.

## Why was this created?

The Minimum Viable Data (MVD) strategy proposes that Building Information Models (BIM) should have the ability to form a relationship between a Revit project model (RVT) and an external database.

This application bridges the gap between asset data managed on Smartsheet with Revit family parameter data. Said differently, this app enables non-BIM stakeholders to update Revit parameter values in Smartsheet, rather than going through the painful process of updating Revit family parameters.

## Requirements
- Unifi Content Management API
- Smartsheet API
