# Unifi-Smartsheet Sync

## Overview

This application synchronizes data between Revit families stored in Unifi and data stored on Smartsheet.

## Why was this created?

The Minimum Viable Data (MVD) strategy proposes that Building Information Models (BIM) should have the ability to form a relationship between a Revit project model (RVT) and some form of an external database. This application bridges the gap between the Revit model and Smartsheet. 

This application bridges the gap between asset data managed on Smartsheet with Revit family parameter data. Said differently, non-BIM stakeholders are able to update Revit parameter values in Smartsheet, rather than going through the painful process of updating Revit family parameters.

## Requirements
- Unifi Content Management API
- Smartsheet API
